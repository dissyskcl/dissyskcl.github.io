Even if interactions between fundamental particles are under control, new laws emerge at large, “life” scales, which are often more complex.\nThe idea of emergence goes beyond, and systems composed of a large number of constituents in interaction, subject to hard-to-predict fluctuations, form a new theoretical paradigm for physics, biology, economy, and other disciplines. This is the ubiquitous subject of complex systems.\nUnderstanding complex systems has real-world impact, but the study of complexity also requires deep and involved mathematics, which during the years produced beautiful mathematical discoveries, such as the mean-field solution of spin glasses or the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for the description of growing interfaces.\nIn the UK there is a strong community of researchers on these and related subjects, and the Disordered Systems group of KCL’s Mathematics Department is at the forefront of research in statistical mechanics of disordered and complex systems. The group focuses its research on both fundamental problems, such as non-equilibrium systems, network theory, soft matter theory, and random matrix theory, and on applications, such as mathematical biology and quantitative medicine, social phenomena, finance, statistics and inference, machine learning.\n\u003c!The Disordered Systems group at King's is at the forefront of research in statistical mechanics of disordered and complex systems. The research of the group concentrates on the development of new methods to tackle both fundamental issues, for example in non-equilibrium systems, and a broad range of applications to complex systems of many interacting units. The latter include mathematical systems biology and quantitative medicine (protein, metabolic and immune networks \u0026 network ensembles) as well as links with statistics and informatics in the area of Bayesian statistical inference and machine learning. The group also has a strong profile in soft condensed matter physics (rheology, polydispersity), glasses and driven non-equilibrium systems. Recent work has led to the development of new models to describe natural and social phenomena, such as systemic risk and catastrophic breakdown in complex systems, with applications to finance and the prediction of power outages. Random matrix theory has become an increasingly important area, studied using extensions of methods for sparse networks.)\u003e ","date":1618704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1618704000,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Modern science has made clear that the reductionist viewpoint is insufficient.

As thermodynamics is a theory for extensive quantities such as the energy, and its fluctuations in space, one looks for a parallel theory that asks about quantities that are spatially transported, say from left to right, over time: currents and their fluctuations. In this series of lectures, I will develop a number of topics to answer some of these questions. I will restrict to the context of two-dimensional spacetime for simplicity, going over the basic ideas and exact results in conformal field theory (CFT) and integrable systems. Topics covered will be: (1) Nonequilibrium steady states in many-body quantum systems that admit ballistic transport. (2) Fluctuations of transported quantities at large times using the largedeviation framework. (3) The relation between static and dynamic fluctuations, and the entanglement entropy and its growth after quenches. As time permits, I will overview hydrodynamic techniques, twist fields techniques, and, in CFT, conformal welding techniques for large-deviation functions. \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; ","date":1662463800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662463800,"objectID":"ae5f16df39dc130fd7a5f799348217ac","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/lectures/ben092022/","publishdate":"2022-09-06T11:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/ben092022/","section":"lectures","summary":"**Benjamin Doyon** on CFT and quantum many-body physics at CRM, leading research institute in mathematics in Canada.","tags":[],"title":"Conformal field theory and quantum many-body physics","type":"lectures"},{"authors":["Gabriele Sicuro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658620800,"objectID":"f4559071ff956665b6e296dc5b8ad33b","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/news/fyodorov2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/fyodorov2022/","section":"news","summary":"A conference in Ascona on the mathematics of complex physical systems, with an emphasis on the interaction between mathematics and physics, to celebrate the 60th birthday of Yan Fyodorov.","tags":["Conferences"],"title":"Random Matrices and Random Landscapes","type":"news"},{"authors":["Gabriele Sicuro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654992000,"objectID":"19e31efd2a6125035fbc252a2f70428f","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/news/meco47/","publishdate":"2022-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/meco47/","section":"news","summary":"The traditional Conference of the Middle European Cooperation in Statistical Physics is organised this year by Silvia Bartolucci, Laura Foini, Gabriele Sicuro and Pierpaolo Vivo in Erice.","tags":["Conferences"],"title":"MECO47","type":"news"},{"authors":["Gabriele Sicuro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654473600,"objectID":"1d0828d67920714e1d16748feab9026e","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/news/bmc2022/","publishdate":"2022-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/bmc2022/","section":"news","summary":"The British Mathematical Colloquium will be hosted at King's College London, and will include a special session on complex systems with a list of prestigious guests including Andrea Montanari and Vittoria Colizza.","tags":["Conferences"],"title":"73rd British Mathematical Colloquium","type":"news"},{"authors":["Pierpaolo Vivo"],"categories":null,"content":" A brief course on applications of random matrix theory given at ICTP Trieste, within the Random Matrices, Random Graphs and Statistical Physics for Machine Learning and Inference school ad ICTP. \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; ","date":1652778000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652778000,"objectID":"0a966ffe0e2a7a73ec817515d9f7e092","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/lectures/pier052022/","publishdate":"2022-05-17T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/pier052022/","section":"lectures","summary":"**Pierpaolo Vivo** gives brief course on applications of random matrix theory to optimisation problems.","tags":["Random Matrix Theory"],"title":"Least-square optimization on the sphere: lessons from RMT and replicas","type":"lectures"},{"authors":["Yan Fyodorov"],"categories":null,"content":" Giorgio Parisi made several groundbreaking contributions to the Physics of Complex Systems. These are systems consisting of many interacting particles, and frequently, in the real world, this interaction is essentially random. He has provided deep insights, both physical and mathematical, into several paradigmatic models which serve as benchmarks in the field. These models, sometimes developed to understand very concrete physical systems, help to elucidate generic (or as physicists frequently call them, \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;) properties, common to a very broad class of phenomena which look remote from the original model.\nOne of the models, now known as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) model, addressed patterns which arise when some material is randomly deposited onto a surface (imagine snowfall on the floor), and in this way the height of the surface grows. It is intuitively clear that the resulting surface becomes rough over time, but to characterize the surface roughness in a precise quantitative way via a tractable mathematical formalism is a very challenging problem. The KPZ model, proposed in 1985, allows such a characterization, possesses beautiful mathematical properties which have been fully understood and utilized only in the last decade, and remains a very active field of research both in Physics and Mathematics.\nAnother beautiful discovery by Parisi (this time without collaborators) stemmed from solving the paradigmatic model of random magnetic materials. To begin with, one may think of standard magnetic substances like iron or steel as a collection of a huge number of elementary \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;atomic magnets\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;, known as \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;spins\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;. These can be usefully visualized as tiny arrows, and each taken alone may point in any direction. In standard magnets neighbouring atoms have a tendency to alligning their arrows along the same direction (one may say they \u0026lsquo;\u0026rsquo;like to look in the same direction\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;), and as the result of such interaction all arrows in the substance will eventually look in the same direction. Such pattern of arrows is obviously highly ordered - one can think of it as a \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;magnetic crystal\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;. However, there exist substances where some pairs of atoms may have a tendency for their \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;arrows\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; to look in the same direction, whereas other pairs of atoms may prefer to have their \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;arrows\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; looking in exactly opposite directions. If the number of \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;alligning\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;anti-alligning\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; pairs are roughly the same the whole pattern of arrows will look at first glance highly irregular, seemingly without order. Such substances are called \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;spin glasses\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; (akin to atoms in usual glasses being not ordered, but randomly positioned in space). A surprising and completely unexpected discovery by Parisi in 1979 was that actually such substances do have an unusual, well hidden order in the pattern of their \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;spin arrows\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;. But this order can not be seen by the naked eye, and can be revealed only by exploiting equally unusual mathematical machinery. To give a flavour of the striking features behind the \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;Parisi solution\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; one may mention that it required to consider geometry in \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;zero spatial dimension\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;! Recall that we live in three-dimensional world; structures in the plane are called two-dimensional, and on a single line one-dimensional. One might think of zero-dimensional object as a single point, and this naively has no structure. Parisi ingeniously suggested that in a certain sense such objects may have a rich hierarchic structure - which in the end helps to describe hidden order in \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;spin glasses\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;. And this is not at all an academic oddity - by now \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;zero dimensional\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; hierarchic patterns discovered by Giorgio Parisi turned out to be relevant in many fields in Physics - ranging from Quantum Gravity to Machine Learning, and eventually in pure mathematical works aiming to understand patterns behind the main building blocks of Arithmetics - the prime numbers.\nParisi\u0026rsquo;s contributions are among the most important to the theory of complex systems, not only in physics but also in other areas such as mathematics, biology, neuroscience, to mention a few. His work gives an example of the power of interdisciplinary research to tackle, understand and solve challenging problems. An example to follow.

In this paper, we study the effect of localized perturbations on the solution of the random dimer problem in two dimensions. By means of an accurate numerical analysis, we show that a local perturbation of the optimal covering induces an excitation whose size is extensive with finite probability. We compute the fractal dimension of the excitations and scaling exponents. In particular, excitations in random dimer problems on nonbipartite lattices have the same statistical properties of domain walls in spin glass. Excitations produced in bipartite lattices, instead, are compatible with a loop-erased self-avoiding random walk process. In both cases, we find evidence of conformal invariance of the excitations that is compatible with $SLE_{\\kappa}$ with parameter $\\kappa$  depending on the bipartiteness of the underlying lattice only.","tags":["Optimization"],"title":"Criticality and conformality in the random dimer model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriele Sicuro","Lenka Zdeborová"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617753600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617753600,"objectID":"e0b35d61fda4d5c5e60909d844d32a90","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/publication/sicuro2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sicuro2021/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the problem of recovering an unknown $k$-factor, hidden in a weighted random graph.

We derive self-consistency equations for the steady-state distribution, which can be solved using a population dynamics algorithm, as well as a full solution for the time evolution of the moments, corroborated with numerical simulations. The generality of the model makes it applicable to many problems and allows for the study of systems exhibiting more complex interactions that those typically considered. The work is relevant to the modelling of barchan dune fields in which interactions between the bedforms and spontaneous fragmentation due to changes in the wind are thought to lead to size-selection.

All applications are processed through the King\u0026rsquo;s appplication system, accessible from the link below.\nKing\u0026rsquo;s application system\nPhD projects The mathematics of adaptive, stable and robust Artificial Intelligence Supervisor: Prof Ivan Tyukin Status: Open.\nThe studentship covers tuition fees for Home/UK students and a stipend of £19,668 per annum. The funding is available for 3.5 years. Overseas applicants will be considered but they must demonstrate the capability to fund the difference between International full-time fees (currently £28,260 per annum for 2023/2024 academic year) and Home/UK fees.\nDescription \u0026mdash; Recent years have seen explosive growth in the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Notwithstanding significant successes of the new technology, empirical evidence points to numerous examples of errors in the decisions of state-of-the-art AI systems. Current theoretical works confirm that modern design practices and classical mathematical frameworks supporting these could suffer from various fundamental shortcomings including the typicality of adversarial attacks, susceptibility to backdoors and stealth attacks, instabilities, and hallucinations. At the same time, there is a plethora of under-explored and seemingly controversial phenomena, such as learning from scarce yet high-dimensional information, which has been broadly observed experimentally in large-scale AI systems but whose complete mathematical understanding is yet to be developed. Other factors hindering the performance of current AI systems include the need to adapt to concept drifts and unforeseen changes in operational conditions. The project aims to explore and systematically assess major causes of AI errors and instabilities and develop appropriate mathematical foundations enabling the creation of stable and robust Artificial Intelligence capable of dealing with errors and concept drifts. The successful candidate will work alongside a team of early career researchers funded by the UKRI Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship (EP/V025295/2) and will benefit from the team’s established relationships with industrial partners, academic networks (Turing AI Fellows, Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Node in Verifiability EP/V026801/2), and other collaborators in academia, healthcare, defence \u0026amp; security.\nHow to apply — To state your interest, please contact directly Prof Ivan Tyukin.\nEntanglement and universality in inhomogeneous and out-of-equilibrium many body quantum systems Supervisors: Dr Paola Ruggiero and Prof Ben Doyon Status: Open.\nWe would like to bring to your attention a funded home-student PhD fellowship available in the Disordered System group at King’s College London. This is to be co-supervised by Dr Paola Ruggiero and Prof Benjamin Doyon, and to start in October 2023. The PhD project covers a broad range of topics in statistical physics and quantum many-body systems, and will be adapted to the interests of the candidate. A general description of the project can be found below.\nDescription \u0026mdash; The project lies at the intersection of several different fields: from statistical physics to quantum information, from high energy to condensed matter physics. The common denominators are the phenomenon of quantum entanglement and the out-of-equilibrium behaviour of many-body quantum systems, particularly in low dimensional quantum many body systems. While the emergence of universality is rather well established for systems which are homogeneous and are at equilibrium, the same is not true for inhomogeneous systems, both in and out of equilibrium. Those, on the other hand, are the rule rather than the exception in the context of quantum experiments. Different new tools are currently under study to investigate what remains of the aforementioned universality in such more complicated situations, and the projects aims to gain a better understanding of this topic, especially through the “lenses” of entanglement. How to apply — If you have home-fees student status, in order to express your interest, please submit first your CV and two reference letters to Paola Ruggiero.

It consists of ribosomes that translate sequences of nucleotides encoded on mRNA into polypeptide sequences of amino acids. Ribosomes bound to mRNA move unidirectionally, while unbound ribosomes diffuse in the cytoplasm. It has been hypothesized that finite diffusion of ribosomes plays an important role in ribosome recycling and that mRNA circularization enhances the efficiency of translation, see e.g. Lodish et al. (Molecular cell biology, 8th edn, W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 2016). In order to estimate the effect of cytoplasmic diffusion on the rate of translation, we consider a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process coupled to a finite diffusive reservoir, which we call the ribosome transport model with diffusion. In this model, we derive an analytical expression for the rate of protein synthesis as a function of the diffusion constant of ribosomes, which is corroborated with results from continuous-time Monte Carlo simulations. Using a wide range of biological relevant parameters, we conclude that diffusion is not a rate limiting factor in translation initiation because diffusion is fast enough in biological cells.

We obtain exact analytic expressions for the inverse participation ratio and show that right eigenvectors of directed random graphs with a small average degree are localized. Remarkably, if the fourth moment of the degree distribution is finite, then the critical mean degree of the localization transition is independent of the degree fluctuations, which is different from localization in undirected graphs that is governed by degree fluctuations. We also show that in the high connectivity limit the distribution of the right eigenvector components is solely determined by the degree distribution. For delocalized eigenvectors, we recover in this limit the universal results from standard random matrix theory that are independent of the degree distribution, while for localized eigenvectors the eigenvector distribution depends on the degree distribution.","tags":[],"title":"Localization and Universality of Eigenvectors in Directed Random Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gioia Boschi","Chiara Cammarota","Reimer Kühn"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618731245,"objectID":"557310e760ccd7595ec48fc3c57a5eea","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/publication/boschi-2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-18T07:34:05.266115Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boschi-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In modern society people are being exposed to numerous information, with some of them being frequently repeated or more disruptive than others.
