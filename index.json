In this paper, we study the effect of localized perturbations on the solution of the random dimer problem in two dimensions. By means of an accurate numerical analysis, we show that a local perturbation of the optimal covering induces an excitation whose size is extensive with finite probability. We compute the fractal dimension of the excitations and scaling exponents. In particular, excitations in random dimer problems on nonbipartite lattices have the same statistical properties of domain walls in spin glass. Excitations produced in bipartite lattices, instead, are compatible with a loop-erased self-avoiding random walk process. In both cases, we find evidence of conformal invariance of the excitations that is compatible with $SLE_{\\kappa}$ with parameter $\\kappa$  depending on the bipartiteness of the underlying lattice only.","tags":["Optimization"],"title":"Criticality and conformality in the random dimer model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriele Sicuro","Lenka Zdeborov√°"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617753600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617753600,"objectID":"e799c9b3472e9c8553b6cffa57617d0c","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/publication/gs2021-1/","publishdate":"2021-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gs2021-1/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the problem of recovering an unknown $k$-factor, hidden in a weighted random graph. For $k=1$ this is the planted matching problem, while the $k=2$ case is closely related to the planted travelling salesman problem. The inference problem is solved by exploiting the information arising from the use of two different distributions for the weights on the edges inside and outside the planted sub-graph. We argue that, in the large size limit, a phase transition can appear between a full and a partial recovery phase as function of the signal-to-noise ratio. We give a criterion for the location of the transition.","tags":["Optimization","Learning and inference","Graph theory"],"title":"The planted $k$-factor problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["The KCL Disordered Systems Group","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Sollich and co-workers have recently provided a definitive answer, combining mathematical theory (polydisperse phase equilibrium calculations) with specialized numerical simulation techniques. The optimal structures are ordered, i.e. crystalline solids, but depending on the density and the spread of particle sizes the system will fractionate: the particles are effectively sorted out into several solid phases, with each containing only a small range of particle sizes.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"6d84ecaea5de99c3930639fb72a7daef","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/project/ps/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ps/","section":"project","summary":"TBA","tags":["Random Matrix Theory"],"title":"Shysical Systems","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A collaboration between group members Kuehn and Perez Castillo and international collaborators also led to a breakthrough in the spectral problem for sparse symmetric random matrices, allowing to efficiently compute spectral densities of such systems in the limit of large matrix size to any desired accuracy \u0026ndash; more than 20 years after a solution to this problem was first attempted.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"f38d20d910f0a730dff05e71165008c2","permalink":"https://dissyskcl.github.io/project/rmt/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rmt/","section":"project","summary":"TBA","tags":["Random Matrix Theory"],"title":"Sparse Symmetric Random Matrices","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Kuehn has provided the first formulation of a microscopic model to describe the emergence of the universal glassy low-temperature anomalies, including an understanding of the origin of the mysterious so-called quantitative universality \u0026ndash; a problem that had been open since its formulation in the late 80s.
